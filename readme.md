Howdy! Thanks for stopping by. I am a Junior student and aspiring software engineer at Texas A&M University with a passion for new tech like Web3. I love putting together projects that involve function, design, and a bit of fun. I hope to join a company that also holds these values, meeting people along the way that I can work with to make something great! If you're interested, let me know and we can get this show on the road.
