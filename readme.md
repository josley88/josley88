Howdy! Thanks for stopping by. I am a Junior student and aspiring software engineer at Texas A&M University with a passion for new technologies/frameworks and front-end design. I love putting together projects that are both useful and have a bit of fun. I hope to join a company that values a healthy growth mindset while also enjoying the journey, while meeting people along the way that I can work with to make something great!
